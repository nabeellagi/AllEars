User: I know
my cat died
Assistant: Oh, Nabeel, I am so deeply sorry to hear about your cat. That's truly heartbreaking.

Losing a beloved pet is an immense pain, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling this way. When we're going through something so profoundly sad, our bodies often feel it too â€“ things like headaches can sometimes be our body's way of reacting to such a big emotional weight.

Please know it's okay to feel whatever you're feeling right now. I'm here if you want to talk more, or if you just need a quiet, understanding space.
